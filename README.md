# spicewal
theme to sync spotify and pywal (with spicetify)

## Credits
Although modified a bit, css styles that make spotify look like spotify-tui were "forked" from [darkthemer](https://github.com/darkthemer)
(who mantains [this repo](https://github.com/darkthemer/spicetify-themes) with various spicetify themes
